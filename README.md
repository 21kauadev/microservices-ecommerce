# Microservices Ecommerce


## ðŸ¤” About

Just a project that I will do to practice microservices architecture.
</br>
It will be a simple E-commerce application, which contains features related to user, product and order entities.

### ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to apply the following things:

- Observability (with Actuator)
- Spring Cloud Config -> for management of configs
- Feign -> for microservices communication
- Eureka -> for Service Registry, Discovery and Load Balancing
- Swagger API (SpringDoc API) -> for Service Documentation
- (Maybe) Api Gateway -> for all application routes centralized.
