# Microservices Ecommerce


## 🤔 About

Just a project that I will do to practice microservices architecture.
</br>
It will be a simple E-commerce application, which contains features related to user, product and order entities.

### 🎯 My goal is to apply the following things:

- Observability (with Actuator)
- Feign -> for microservices communication
- Eureka -> for Service Registry, Discovery and Load Balancing
- Swagger API (SpringDoc API) -> for Service Documentation
- Api Gateway -> for all application routes centralized.
